# Haunted-Tour-Twine

Welcome to our virtual tour! Since its establishment in 1855, Michigan State University has developed its own unique history that has led to numerous legends, including some spooky ones! To share all we know about the history of these ghostly sites and stories, the Campus Archaeology Program has combined written, photographic, cartographic, and archaeological evidence. Join us as we explore these sites, their past, and their place on campus today. The Apparitions and Archaeology or Haunted Campus Tour has traditionally been a joint effort between CAP and the MSU Paranormal Society to guide interested – and brave! – visitors around sites on campus known for their paranormal activity and archaeological significance.

Things are definitely looking a little different here in fall 2020, as MSU has made the decision to stay remote for the entire semester. CAP has had to adapt quickly to a new world where it is not safe to go out in the field or to hold many of our usual events. This year our Apparitions and Archaeology Tour is hosted on Twine – a user-friendly and open-sourced tool with a “choose your own adventure” format. And because of the new digital interface, we are, for the first time ever, able to include ALL of the sites!

                                                              3. Saints’ Rest

                                                              4. 1900 Class Fountain

                                                              5. Morrill Hall

                                                              7. Beal Garden

                                                              8. MSU Museum 

To navigate our Twine Tour, click on each site to first learn a bit about its history as a part of MSU’s campus. Then choose to either learn more about the archaeology of that site – all excavated by CAP – or learn more about the chilling stories that have been passed down throughout the years! But that’s not all! As you scroll through our Twine, click on any word that is colored orange – each of these words will lead you to new pages with more information on the particulars of that site, related buildings, archaeological terms, and much more! 

It may be easy to get lost, but never fear – scroll to the bottom of each page to find links to each of the eight sites to start all over again! And as you visit more and more pages, blue words will indicate pages that you have already visited so you won’t lose track.

We hope you enjoy our tour as much as we did making it! <a href="http://campusarch.msu.edu/hauntedtour/" target"_blank">Click here to start our Tour!</a>
