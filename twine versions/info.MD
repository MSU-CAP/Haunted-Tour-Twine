There are many versions of this twine tour as Rhian and Jeff worked on it collaboratively - emailing the html file back and forth as they built it. Proofing edits were also made in the same fashion. When this repo was created in 2022, only the most recent versions were added. Generally speaking - whole number version changes indicate significant edits and decimal point version changes indicate minor proofing or code changes. Between version 36 and 37 the major update was changing all image URLs from those storied in Jeff's personal GitHub repository to this one here. Version 37.1 includes minor proofing changes.

To preview thiis tour copy the version you wish to test into the Index.HTML file, move this file into the main level, and refresh the GitHub using the pages function. The live version of the tour is located on the CAP Website: http://campusarch.msu.edu/hauntedtour/.
